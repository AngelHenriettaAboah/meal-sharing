# Mama G Meal Sharing App

[Demo Website](https://meal-sharing-fa4o.onrender.com/)

## Description

The Meal Sharing App is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate meal sharing among users. Developed as an individual project task for Hack Your Future Denmark, this app utilizes modern technologies for both frontend and backend development. Users can explore available meals, make reservations, and interact with the platform seamlessly. Both the backend and Frontend were deployed on Render.

### Main Functionalities

- **Homepage**: Users can navigate through the homepage to discover available meals and other potential contents.
- **Interactive Button**: Clickable button redirects users to another page for further interaction.
- **Reservation Form**: A form enables users to make reservations using meal IDs.
- **Review Form**: A form enables users to add reviews using meal IDs.
- **Database Integration**: Meals stored in a MySQL database are displayed on the platform.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, CSS Modules
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgresSQL
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: KnexJS

## What I Learned Vs Challenges

- Rendering components effectively in React.
- Establishing backend-to-frontend and backend-to-database connections.
- Utilizing KnexJS, including its `knex.raw` functionality.

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building a Star component for leaving a rating for a meal, a Modal component, making the website more responsive and fit for all screen sizes as well as having to deploy the app on Render.

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with ExpressJS, NodeJS, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL to build a full-stack web application.

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
